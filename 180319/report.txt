For the current app I:
	* Created a wrapper class for Volley.
	* Created an interface to communicate the results obtained from fetching an online resource asynchronously.
	* Created a listview for displaying the categories of my CMSs posts.
	* Created a listview for displaying the posts of each category of my CMS.
	* Created a webview to render the contents of posts when chosen.

Volley VS Retrofit:
	* Retrofit uses Java annotations (sentences beginning with @) to create interfaces that translate to HTTP requests.
	* It has a model to translate payloads to objects.
	* It is converter agnostic.
