For the current app I:
	* Created a subclass of AsyncTask.
	* Created an interface to communicate the results obtained from fetching an online resource asynchronously.
	* Created a listview for displaying the categories of my CMSs posts.
	* Created a listview for displaying the posts of each category of my CMS.
	* Created a webview to render the contents of posts when chosen.

Volley VS AsyncTask:
	* Volley abstracts threading.
	* Volley takes care of parsing.
	* Volley is not a native library.
