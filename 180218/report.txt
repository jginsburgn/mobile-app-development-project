For the development of this bottom navigation combined application:

	1. I made use of Fragments in order to keep material design aligned with the bottom menu.
	2. I learnt how contexts work based on activities, and not fragments.
	3. I learnt how to use startActivityForResult() to wait for a response when an activity ends.
	4. I learnt how to use shared preferences.
	5. I learnt how to use autocomplete.
