During today's lecture we learnt:

Android Applications' Life Cycle.
	The lifecycle executes several methods of activities as shown on the directions.pdf image. They can be harnessed to achieve tasks according to state changes of the app.
	
Logging.
	We used three methods of active logging in an Android App: Alerts, Toasts and Console logs.
