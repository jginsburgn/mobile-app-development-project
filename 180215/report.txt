For the development of this rating application:

	1. I created complex views including lots of input GUI components. Gathering all the information required for the survey posed a challenge of being particularily organized with the resources.
	2. I learned how to close the application upon finishing its purpose, with finish.
	3. I learned how to ask for permissions during application runtime.
	4. I learned how to start a call programatically.
